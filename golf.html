            <h1> Why I started to play golf? </h1>
            <p> I started playing golf since I was 10 years old. When I was younger, my dad always took me to the course on Saturday with him and I started to enjoy playing golf from there</p>
            <h1> Golf Timeline</h1>
            <h4 class="timeline"> Junior golf in Thailand -- 2010-2014 </h4>
            <p> Back when I started playing golf. I started playing in ISF, which is a small organization that hosts tournaments for junior golfer who just stared playing golf. After winning a few tournaments at ISF. I know that I'm ready for more challenges, so I started to playing in TJGA, stands for "Thailand Junior Golf Association". Growing up in the city, there are only driving ranges in Thailand, so it's not very hard to find any short game facility. That's when my family decided to send me to IMG Academy where all types of facilities are ready for my to utilize </p>
            <h4 class="timeline"> Golf at IMG Academy -- 2014-2018 </h4>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed my time at IMG Academy. Living in the United States teaches me more than just how to be a better golfer. I wasn't very good at English that first year, so it was not easy to make friends in other nationality than Thai.
            </p>
            <h4 class="timeline"> Golf at UC Davis -- 2018-current </h4>
            <p>
                First year at UC Davis was not easy. Managing the time to go workout in the at 6am every morning, then go to classes after that, followed by going to practice in the after was very tiring for me.
